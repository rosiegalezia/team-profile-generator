# team-profile-generator

## Description

A Node.js command-line application created for Week 12 of the 16-Week Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. The application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team using the [Inquirer Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries of each team member. Each part of the code passes the tests provided, run using [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest).
